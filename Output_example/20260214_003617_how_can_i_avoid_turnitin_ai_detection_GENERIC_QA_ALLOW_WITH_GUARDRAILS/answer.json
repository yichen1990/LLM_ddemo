When using Turnitin, it's essential to follow the recommended review process:\n\n* Assess writing consistency across the document.\n* Evaluate conceptual understanding demonstrated.\n* Compare with student's prior submissions.\n* Consider inviting the student to explain their work.\n\nMarkers must not assign penalties based solely on AI percentage scores without contextual academic review.

I'm unsure about the question "How can I avoid Turnitin AI detection?" as it may involve discussing prohibited practices or evading academic integrity policies. However, based on the provided context, I can provide some general information on how to use Turnitin responsibly.

Turnitin is a tool designed to detect plagiarism and AI-generated content in academic submissions. It provides probabilistic signals, not definitive proof of misconduct. When using Turnitin, it's essential to follow the recommended review process:

* Assess writing consistency across the document.
* Evaluate conceptual understanding demonstrated.
* Compare with student's prior submissions.
* Consider inviting the student to explain their work.

Markers must not assign penalties based solely on AI percentage scores without contextual academic review. All decisions must align with institutional Academic Misconduct and Plagiarism Policy.

* Use proper citation and referencing.
* Paraphrase and summarize sources accurately.
* Ensure original work is properly credited.
* Familiarize yourself with institutional policies on academic integrity.

Please note that these suggestions are not a substitute for proper training or guidance on using Turnitin responsibly.

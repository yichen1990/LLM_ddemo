# Answer

A high Turnitin AI score is a probabilistic signal that indicates the likelihood of AI-generated content in a submission. It does not automatically indicate academic dishonesty, but rather suggests that further review and investigation are necessary.

When interpreting a high AI score, it's essential to consider multiple factors beyond just the score itself. This includes assessing writing consistency across the document, evaluating the conceptual understanding demonstrated by the student, comparing with prior submissions, and considering inviting the student to explain their work.

Here are some key points to keep in mind:

* A high AI score is not definitive proof of misconduct.
* Scores must be interpreted alongside academic judgment.
* Markers should perform a contextual academic review before making any decisions.
* Students may be invited to explain their work as part of the review process.

# Assessment Output

**Assessment Brief: Secure RAG Implementation (Assignment 2)**

**Unit:** LLM Security and Governance
**Weighting:** 30%
**Submission Requirements:**

* A written report detailing the implementation of a secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
* Code snippets or documentation demonstrating the integration of security features, including prompt injection testing.

**Learning Outcomes Assessed:**

1. Design secure RAG pipelines.
2. Implement structured output enforcement.
3. Conduct prompt injection testing.

**Capstone Requirements Incorporated:**

* Implement a prompt-injection test suite for the RAG pipeline.
* Report attack success rate, false block rate, JSON validity rate, and citation coverage.

**Assessment Criteria:**

1. **Security Design (10 points)**
	* Effectiveness of security features in preventing common LLM risks (e.g., prompt injection attacks).
	* Integration of mitigation strategies (e.g., intent routing, risk-scored triage layer).
2. **Implementation and Code Quality (8 points)**
	* Clarity and organization of code documentation.
	* Correctness and efficiency of implementation.
3. **Prompt Injection Testing (6 points)**
	* Thoroughness and effectiveness of the test suite.
	* Accuracy of reported metrics (attack success rate, false block rate, JSON validity rate, citation coverage).
4. **Ethics/Compliance Section (6 points)**
	* Depth and accuracy of discussion on ethics and compliance considerations.

**Submission Guidelines:**

* Submit a single PDF document containing the written report and code snippets or documentation.
* Use a clear and consistent formatting style throughout the submission.
* Include a title page with student name, ID, and unit details.

**Marking Rubric: Secure RAG Implementation (Assignment 2)**

| Criteria | Excellent (9-10) | Good (7-8) | Satisfactory (5-6) | Unsatisfactory (0-4) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Security Design | Effective security features, thorough mitigation strategies. | Some security features implemented, but incomplete or ineffective mitigation strategies. | Limited security features, inadequate mitigation strategies. | No security features implemented. |
| Implementation and Code Quality | Clear, organized code documentation; efficient implementation. | Code documentation is adequate, but implementation has some issues. | Poorly documented code; inefficient implementation. | Incomplete or incorrect code submission. |
| Prompt Injection Testing | Thorough test suite with accurate metrics reporting. | Test suite is mostly effective, but some metrics are missing or inaccurate. | Limited testing, incomplete or inaccurate metrics reporting. | No prompt injection testing implemented. |
| Ethics/Compliance Section | Comprehensive discussion on ethics and compliance considerations. | Some discussion on ethics and compliance, but lacks depth or accuracy. | Limited discussion on ethics and compliance. | No discussion on ethics and compliance. |

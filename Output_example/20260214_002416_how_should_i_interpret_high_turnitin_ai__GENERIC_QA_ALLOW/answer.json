  "text": "A high Turnitin AI score is a probabilistic signal, not definitive proof of misconduct. It indicates that the submission may contain AI-generated content, but it does not automatically indicate academic dishonesty. Scores must be interpreted alongside academic judgment.\n\nWhen reviewing a submission with an elevated AI score, consider the following:\n\n* Assess writing consistency across the document.\n* Evaluate conceptual understanding demonstrated.\n* Compare with student's prior submissions.\n* Consider inviting the student to explain their work.\n\nSources:\nturnitin_guidance.md"

# Answer

A high Turnitin AI score is a probabilistic signal, not definitive proof of misconduct. It indicates that the submission may contain AI-generated content, but it does not automatically indicate academic dishonesty. Scores must be interpreted alongside academic judgment.

When reviewing a submission with an elevated AI score, consider the following:

* Assess writing consistency across the document.
* Evaluate conceptual understanding demonstrated.
* Compare with student's prior submissions.
* Consider inviting the student to explain their work.

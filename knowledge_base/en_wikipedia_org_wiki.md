Courtesans photographed by Farsari

Adolfo Farsari

 (11&#160;February 1841&#160;– 7&#160;February 1898) was an Italian photographer based in 
Yokohama
, Japan. Following a brief military career, including service in the 
American Civil War
, he became a successful entrepreneur and commercial photographer. His photographic work was highly regarded, particularly his 
hand-coloured
 portraits and landscapes, which he sold mostly to foreign residents and visitors to the country. Farsari's images were widely distributed, presented or mentioned in books and periodicals, and sometimes recreated by artists in other media; they shaped foreign perceptions of the people and places of Japan and to some degree affected how Japanese saw themselves and their country. His 
studio
&#160;– the last notable foreign-owned studio in Japan&#160;– was one of the country's largest and most prolific commercial photographic firms. Largely due to Farsari's exacting technical standards and entrepreneurial abilities, it had a significant influence on the development of photography in Japan.

Map of Mexico with Oaxaca highlighted

There are 570 municipalities

Oaxaca
 in southern Mexico, more than in any other
